PAPER: An Integrated Instance-Based Learning Algorithm 

Abstract: 
- Good generalization in several domains
- There are several shortcomings: 
	- Inappropriate distance functions 
	- Large storage reqs 
	- slow execution time 
	- sensitivity to noise 
	- inability to adjust decision boundaries after storing the train data.
